Learning Objectives:

Escaping special characters in shell
Removing, moving and making files
Creating directories
Basic shell scripting II
Basic Conditionals I
Googling
Theory
A great programmer is not someone who writes 100 code lines per minute, but
someone who can work through technical details and understand what is important
right now (and what is not) and use that info to achieve his objectives. This
skill is not only vital for programmers, but IT technicians, system
administrators, researchers etc.

You'll have most likely used Google in the previous task to learn about piping,
but this task will require you to use it for all the commands, since we won't
give out any hints on the commands used here.

Some characters in the shell are special, and will cause the shell to act in
unexpected ways without another special character to cancel it's effect.

This task will also feature the first use of conditionals. You'll need to Google
on how to write conditionals in the shell for this task, but we will write more
about conditionals in the next task.

Instructions
These instructions seem daunting, but a wise friend called "Google" has offered
to help you in these troubling times...

In the file files.sh, write the commands that do the following in the
specified order:

Create files a, !, \ and "
Create a directory called `
Copy the file ! into `
If the environment variable called MOVE_A has the value yes, move the a
file into the ` directory. If it's no, remove the file. Otherwise
(variable is unset or is something else), leave the file as is.
Hints
You'll need to use Google for this task. Think about how you would phrase your
question, and then type it into Google. Modify that phrase until you get what
you want.
