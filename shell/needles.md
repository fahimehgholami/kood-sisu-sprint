Needles In a Haystack
Learning Objectives:

Learn to search for given lines in files
Basic regular expressions
Basic piping
Theory
grep is among the most useful commands in Unix shells. It allows you find where
specific text occurs at specific lines. This can be helpful in, for example,
reading logs.

Another important concept in the shell world is piping. Piping allows you to put
the output of one command as the input of the next command. You'll need to Google
about piping for this task.

Instructions
Download this file that you can test your commands against:

wget https://study.koodsisu.fi/resource/hay.txt
Finding the needles...
This file seems to contain a lot of repeated lines, but something in you says
that some lines are not like the others.

You must find the lines that contain the word 'not'.

...and counting them
That's a lot of needles, now if there was some way to count them accurately...

Your script must output the number of lines that contain the word 'not'

Hints
The only commands you need are grep and wc. And of course, there's the
always helpful man command...
